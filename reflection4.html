         this 4th ict quarter, is very interesting, dare i say.. more interesting than the last quarters. why? cause it deals with .. idk actually.
its fun to see what i write in the notepad, from the imagination of my brain, into the website, and watch it come to life! its cool
working with alerts, writing stupid things on the button and making the alert say stupid things and making myself laugh with
my dumb jokes. but its really interesting to me and really cool with how basic the code im learning is, i can make mountains
of it and turn it into a whole new different purpose. i think thats the beauty of coding and creativity in general. i would like 
to thank ms uminga for always being patient and giving with our section, and ultimately i strive to become a person like her.
